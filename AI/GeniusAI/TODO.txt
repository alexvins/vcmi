1. Decompose the CGeniusAI into several files (with classes/structures/etc.).
2. Check whether or not, the part can be made more independent (by loosening 
the connections between them).
3. Finish/double check the int->si16 conversions (and similar).
4. Finish cleaning up the style of the code (alignment, braces, etc.).
5. Create additional define USE_PCH, in case someone doesn't like macros.
6. Clear/update the StdAfx & Common.h.
7. Substitute the hand-written loops by foreach-s.
