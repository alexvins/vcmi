In this directory, the UML diagrams - describing the AI for the VCMI project - will be stored. As the tool to work with UML diagrams, the Bouml was chosen, for the following reasons:
* Free of charge
* Acceptable set of features (i.e., enough to model the project)
* Continous developer support
* Support for group modelling
* Portable (ported basically to all biggest platforms)
* Efficient


!!! IMPORTANT !!!
If you want to modify the UML diagrams:
1. Download Bouml.
2. Configure it's settings and set your user number (the first dialog box) to any, except numbers that are already taken by other team members (written below).
3. Add your chosen number (together with your name/nick) to the list.
4. Read: http://bouml.free.fr/doc/index_projectsynchro.html.
5. Before every change you made to the project, run the "Project Synchro".
6. Have fun!
